To build the demo program in any of these subdirectories, simply
change directory to the desired directory and type "nmake".
This will build the example program(s) (*.exe file) for that directory.

NOTE on the PM programs.  To exit out of all of the PM programs use Alt-F4.

Some environment variables you will want to set include: (assuming
of course that you have the SOMobjects Toolkit installed on your
D: drive in the D:\SOM directory)

PATH=d:\SOM\BIN;%PATH%
DPATH=d:\SOM\MSG;%DPATH%
LIB=d:\SOM\LIB;%LIB%
INCLUDE=d:\SOM\INCLUDE;%INCLUDE%
SMINCLUDE=.;d:\SOM\INCLUDE;d:\toolkt21\sc;
SOMIR=d:\SOM\ETC\som.ir;som.ir;
SOMBASE=d:\SOM
SMTMP=d:\SOM\TMP
SMEMIT=h;ih;

and in your config.sys LIBPATH= assignment add:
 d:\som\dll   or
 d:\som\lib

depending on where you have your SOM DLLs stored.

Also, these examples were all compiled with the IBM C Set/2 compiler

**  There is a known bug on this example.  It should be an easy one
to fix.  When running "eaview" in the current directory the program
works, but if you attempt to view the extended attributes on a directory
that is not the current directory you may get errors.  For example:

> eaview                          // will work on the current directory

but

> eaview c:\os2                   // will not work nor will ...
> eaview c:\os2\*                 // this also will not work

to see the extended attributes of the C:\os2 directory you must
first change drive and directory to that location before executing
the 'eaview' program.  As in the following sequence:

> C:
> CD \os2
> eaview                 // works
 ....
> eaview *               // also works
 ....
> eaview *.exe           // works too!
 ....
